# Jarvis

I am using Machine Learning to create a text based assistant that will support the following features:

1.Understand the context of natural language and answer simple questions
2.Display files using simple human like instructions
3.Run programs
4.Perform Web Searches and return results.


I will add some more features soon!

# What am I gonna use?

1. Natural Language Processing 
2. Machine Learning
3. Deep Learning


# Technologies used:

1. Python
2. Tensorflow
3. Keras


This is going to be a winter project! Contributors are welcome!
